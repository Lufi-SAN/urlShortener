Where is caching done? What are the triggers?
Where is logging? Called everywhere a console.log would be or only controllers?

Logging
1. Global - app.use(middleware) in index.ts
2. Then in service layer
3. Then a Global Error Logger (in global error handler in index.ts)

Controllers
1. Get request, Send Response, next() OR next(error)
2. Get data out of request (req.body, params, query, user(auth middleware))
3. Call Service layer with request data (use JS data only)
4. Catch errors from Service layer
5. NEVER calls Store layer

Service layer
1. Get data from controller. Format data, run computational logic here
2. Throw errors TO Controllers
3. Call Store layer with schema(format) store desires
4. Catch store errors here then throw to controllers
5. Call to db here to pull stored data
6. Send db data to controller + format data if required
7. Place cache checks (before db call) & cache stores here (after receiving from db)

Store layer
1. Throw errors on queries
2. Pull from db to service layer, Push to db when service layer orders so
