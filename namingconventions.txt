Service names
1. services are grouped by routes
2. service/[route_its_under]/[service names] should be same name of controller that calls them
CONTROLLERS might or might not need a service so not every controller = service (Basically, more controllers than there are services)

Controllers = Routes
1. controller names should be same as their routes. Easy because its only one controller file exposing all possible controllers (Basically, controllers = routes)

Name store files according to service calling them
1. If a service needs a store - CREATE NEW STORE LOGIC
store/[service-name]/[store-name]
